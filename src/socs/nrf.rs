/// This flag atomically represents the current alarm state.

///
/// This flag synchronizes exclusive ownership of the alarm between the
/// interrupt and the scheduling process:
///
/// - While the alarm is active, corresponding interrupts may fire at any
///   time, preempt the scheduling thread and access and mutate the alarm as
///   well as related hardware registers.
/// - While the alarm is pending or after it fired, the alarm data must not be
///   accessed from interrupt context. The scheduling thread can then access and
///   mutate the alarm as well as related hardware registers.
///
/// The alarm must not be accessed or mutated from any other than scheduling
/// or interrupt context.
///
/// Considered alternatives, that don't work:
///
/// Synchronization via interrupt registers:
/// - LDREX/STREX are disallowed on device memory
/// - interrupts remain disabled while we wait for the active half period
/// - depending on the configuration several distinct (RTC vs. TIMER) or no
///   interrupt at all (event triggering) may be involved.
///
/// Synchronization via a special value of the RTC tick (Self::OFF):
/// - The overflow-protected RTC tick is 64 bits wide. A 64 bit value cannot
///   be accessed atomically on a 32 bit platform. Portable atomics would
///   introduce a critical section. This is what we want to avoid.
///
/// Note that the safety conditions of the [`RadioTimerApi`] require the
/// timer interrupt to run at a higher priority than the scheduling thread.
/// This means that the interrupt continues to own the alarm while it is
/// active even if it sets the flag to `false`.

    /// `periods << 24 + counter`. So, the logic around an overflow would look

    /// periods = 1, counter = 0xFF_FFFE --> now = 0x1FF_FFFE
    /// periods = 1, counter = 0xFF_FFFF --> now = 0x1FF_FFFF
    /// **OVERFLOW**

    /// periods = 2, counter = 0x00_0001 --> now = 0x200_0001
    /// ```
    ///
    /// The problem is that this is vulnerable to race conditions if `now()`
    /// runs at the exact time an overflow happens.
    ///
    /// If `now()` reads `periods` first and `counter` later, and overflow
    /// happens between the reads, it would return a wrong value:
    ///
    /// ```not_rust
    /// periods = 1 (OLD), counter = 0x00_0000 (NEW) --> now = 0x100_0000 -> WRONG
    /// ```
    ///
    /// It fails similarly if it reads `counter` first and `periods` second.
    ///
    /// To fix this, we define a "half period" to be 2^23 ticks (instead of
    /// 2^24). One "overflow cycle" is 2 periods.
    ///
    /// - `half period` is incremented on overflow (at counter value 0)
    /// - `half period` is incremented "midway" between overflows (at counter
    ///   value 0x80_0000)
    ///
    /// Therefore, when `half period` is even, the counter is expected to be in
    /// the range 0..0x7f_ffff, when odd, in the range 0x80_0000..0xff_ffff.
    ///
    /// To get `now()`, the `half period` is read first, then the `counter`. If
    /// the counter value range matches the expected `half period` parity, we're
    /// done. If it doesn't, we know that a new half period has started between
    /// reading `period` and `counter`. We then assume that the `counter` value
    /// corresponds to the next half period.
    ///
    /// The `half period` has 32 bits and a single half period is represented by
